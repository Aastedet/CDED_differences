# Summary of investigating the first 10 subject ID's of Table A1 in the paper:

- Subject ID's S0030, S0064, S0068 and S0153 are in the dataset with the same race and height (approximately), but most are recorded as being heavier, and S0030 and S0064 as having HTN in medical records, which is not the case in the dataset.
- Subjects S0121, S0154, S0160, S0163, S0164, S0165 are not in the dataset at all.
